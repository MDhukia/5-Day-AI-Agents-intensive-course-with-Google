# 🤖 5-Day AI Agents Intensive Course with Google & Kaggle

I am excited to complete the Kaggle x Google 5-Day AI Agents Intensive Course!
This repository serves as my learning journal, containing notes, code experiments, and insights gathered while exploring the next generation of intelligent, autonomous AI systems. 🚀

This program helped me understand how to take an idea from a simple prompt → to a fully production-ready multi-agent system using Google’s Agent Development Kit (ADK), MCP, memory, tools, and deployment workflows.

# 📅 Course Outline & Key Milestones
# 🗓️ Day 1: Agent Foundations

A deep dive into the core principles of AI agents:

What makes an agent autonomous

Components like Tools, Memory, and Observability

Differences between agents & traditional prompt engineering
This day set the foundation for all upcoming hands-on work.

# 🗓️ Day 2: Tool Integration & The Power of MCP

Learned how to give agents real-world abilities using tools:

Model Context Protocol (MCP) for tool discovery

Using files, APIs, and external services

Creating custom tools for web scraping, parsing, and more
This unlocked action-taking capabilities for agents.

# 🗓️ Day 3: Context Engineering — Memory & State Management

Focused on building agents that remember.
Key takeaways:

Short-term vs long-term memory

Dataset-backed memory

Context persistence for multi-turn conversation
Memory made agents more reliable, personalized, and powerful.

# 🗓️ Day 4: Agent Quality, Observability & Evaluation

Explored how to create robust, trustworthy agents:

Logging & tracing

Golden tests and evaluation prompts

Event-level observability

Quality metrics for agentic workflows
This day covered everything needed for enterprise-grade reliability.

# 🗓️ Day 5: Scaling, Agent2Agent (A2A) Protocol & Deployment

Finally, learned how to take agents from local prototypes → production:

Multi-agent communication using the A2A Protocol

Building pipelines of independent agents

Deploying agents using Vertex AI Agent Engine

Managing scaling, endpoints, and real-world workloads

This marked the transition from learning → real deployment.

# 🧠 Core Concepts Mastered

Agentic architectures & autonomous task execution

Tools & MCP for agent action-taking

Memory engineering & session management

Agent quality, evaluation, and continuous monitoring

Multi-agent systems using A2A Protocol

Deployment strategies using Google Cloud

# 🎯 My Personal Learning Goals

Throughout this course, I aimed to:

Build real, context-aware agents using ADK

Integrate tools and memory for advanced capabilities

Understand how to evaluate and improve agent reliability

Learn how to deploy and scale multi-agent systems

This course gave me hands-on experience in all of these areas.
