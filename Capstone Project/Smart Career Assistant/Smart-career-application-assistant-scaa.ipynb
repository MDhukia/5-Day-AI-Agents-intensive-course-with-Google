Introduction\n\nThe Smart Career Application Assistant (SCAA) is an AI-powered agent designed to help job seekers quickly understand their strengths, improve their resumes, and receive career recommendations. This project uses the Google Agent Development Kit (ADK), Gemini LLM models, and tool integrations to perform resume analysis and provide real-time job market insights.\n\nSCAA automates key stages of the job application process, including skill extraction, job role suggestions, resume improvement tips, salary research, and cover letter generation.\n\n📘 2. Project Objective\n\nMany job seekers struggle to understand:\n\nWhat skills their resume highlights\n\nWhich job roles match their profile\n\nHow to improve their resume\n\nWhat skills are in demand today\nCurrent salary trends\n\nThis project solves these problems with one intelligent agent that analyzes resumes and provides actionable insights within seconds.\n\n📘 3. What This Notebook Demonstrates (Capstone Requirements)\n\nThis notebook implements five ADK concepts (more than the minimum three required):\n\n✔ 1. LLM-powered agent using Gemini ✔ 2. Built-in ADK Tool: google_search ✔ 3. Custom Tool: Python skill extractor ✔ 4. File processing: Automated PDF resume extraction ✔ 5. Observability: run_debug() call with agent trace\n\nThese features combined form a full, real-world career assistant system.\n\n📘 4. System Workflow Overview\n\nLoad Resume (PDF) from Kaggle input\n\nExtract text using pdfplumber\n\nExtract skills using custom Python tool\n\nSend resume + skills to ADK agent\n\nAgent performs:\n\nResume summary\n\nJob role recommendations\n\nResume improvements\n\ngoogle_search tool call for job market trends\n\nCover letter generation\n\nThis creates a complete AI-driven career analysis pipeline.\n\n📘 5. Tools & Technologies Used\n\nGoogle ADK (Agent Development Kit)\n\nGemini 2.5 Flash Lite\n\ngoogle_search Tool\n\nCustom Python Skill Extractor\n\nPDF text extraction using pdfplumber\n\nInMemoryRunner for debugging & agent flow\n\nKaggle Notebook environment\n\n📘 6. Key Features Implemented\n\n✔ Resume PDF Upload & Extraction\n\nThe system loads and processes a PDF file directly from the Kaggle dataset.\n\n✔ Skill Extraction Tool\n\nA custom Python tool extracts relevant technical skills from the resume text.\n\n✔ Intelligent Agent Reasoning\n\nThe ADK agent analyzes skills and provides smart recommendations.\n\n✔ Google Search Integration\n\nAgent fetches real-time market insights:\n\nSalary trends\n\nIn-demand skills\n\nJob descriptions\n\n✔ Cover Letter Generation\n\nThe agent creates a personalized, professional cover letter.\n\n📘 7. Results\n\nThe Smart Career Application Assistant produces:\n\nExtracted skills\n\nThree-point resume summary\n\nRecommended job roles\n\nResume improvement tips\n\nMarket skill demand\n\nSalary insights\n\nAuto-generated cover letter\n\nThese results significantly reduce the time required for job preparation.\n\n📘 8. Conclusion\n\nThe Smart Career Application Assistant (SCAA) demonstrates how a single ADK agent can combine local tools, LLM intelligence, and real-time search to build a practical, high-impact application. This project successfully automates career guidance and highlights the power of intelligent agents for real-world productivity.\n\n📘 9. Future Improvements\n\nAdd multi-agent system (Resume Agent + Salary Agent + Job Match Agent)\n\nIntroduce memory to personalize recommendations over time\n\nDeploy as a web application\n\nAdd PDF section detection (Education, Experience, etc.)\n\nJob–Resume Match Scoring\n\n","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"# This Python 3 environment comes with many helpful analytics libraries installed\n# It is defined by the kaggle/python Docker image: https://github.com/kaggle/docker-python\n# For example, here's several helpful packages to load\n\nimport numpy as np # linear algebra\nimport pandas as pd # data processing, CSV file I/O (e.g. pd.read_csv)\n\n# Input data files are available in the read-only \"../input/\" directory\n# For example, running this (by clicking run or pressing Shift+Enter) will list all files under the input directory\n\nimport os\nfor dirname, _, filenames in os.walk('/kaggle/input'):\n    for filename in filenames:\n        print(os.path.join(dirname, filename))\n\n# You can write up to 20GB to the current directory (/kaggle/working/) that gets preserved as output when you create a version using \"Save & Run All\" \n# You can also write temporary files to /kaggle/temp/, but they won't be saved outside of the current session","metadata":{"trusted":true,"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2025-12-01T05:36:01.795566Z","iopub.execute_input":"2025-12-01T05:36:01.795851Z","iopub.status.idle":"2025-12-01T05:36:03.869710Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2025-12-01T05:36:01.795820Z","shell.execute_reply":"2025-12-01T05:36:03.868763Z"}},"outputs":[{"name":"stdout","text":"/kaggle/input/resumee/resumeidea.pdf\n","output_type":"stream"}],"execution_count":1},{"cell_type":"code","source":"!adk web\n","metadata":{"trusted":true,"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2025-12-01T05:36:18.918167Z","iopub.execute_input":"2025-12-01T05:36:18.918478Z","iopub.status.idle":"2025-12-01T06:18:15.091667Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2025-12-01T05:36:18.918455Z","shell.execute_reply":"2025-12-01T06:18:15.090520Z"}},"outputs":[{"name":"stdout","text":"/usr/local/lib/python3.11/dist-packages/google/adk/cli/fast_api.py:130: UserWarning: [EXPERIMENTAL] InMemoryCredentialService: This feature is experimental and may change or be removed in future versions without notice.

Suitable Job Roles:**\n\n*   **Data Analyst:** This is a direct fit, given his internship experience, proficiency in SQL and visualization tools like Tableau and Power BI, and his ability to present insights. His Python and Pandas skills further enhance his capability for data cleaning and preparation.\n*   **Business Intelligence (BI) Developer:** His experience in building dashboards using Tableau and Power BI, along with presenting insights, directly aligns with the responsibilities of a BI Developer. The automation skills with Python could also be valuable for streamlining BI processes.\n*   **Junior Data Scientist:** While his resume emphasizes data analysis, the \"Machine Learning Basics\" listed in his skills, combined with his Python proficiency, could make him a candidate for entry-level data science roles, especially those that involve significant data wrangling and feature engineering.\n\n**3. Resume Improvement Recommendations:**\n\n*   **Quantify Achievements:** Instead of stating \"Presented insights that improved decision-making processes,\" quantify the impact. For example, \"Presented data-driven insights that led to a 10% reduction in operational costs\" or \"Automated data cleaning workflows using Python and Pandas, saving an estimated 5 hours of manual work per week.\"\n*   **Elaborate on \"Machine Learning Basics\":** Since this is a key differentiator for data science roles, expand on it. Briefly mention any specific algorithms or projects (even academic ones) where he applied basic machine learning concepts. For instance, \"Applied basic machine learning algorithms (e.g., linear regression, k-means clustering) for [specific purpose] during academic projects.\"\n*   **Action-Oriented Language:** Start bullet points with strong action verbs.
